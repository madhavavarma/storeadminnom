Nom Nom Project

Born in kitchen, raised by flavor's, and emotionally damaged by under-seasoned food

We don't just cook -- we plot, play, and sometimes even pray over pot.
Every dish begins somewhere between a craving an a cultural flashback!
Nom Nom is a glorified food diary - It's a living archive of edible drama. It's culture, history, tantrums, and a good butter-glistened bribe.
